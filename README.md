Project Description:
This project aims to create an intuitive and interactive hand-held device that can be played as a musical instrument. By integrating sound synthesis and touch-sensitive controls, the device will allow users to create and manipulate musical synth sounds. Featuring scale selection dynamic pitch modulation and differing synth settings, it offers a unique and engaging way to explore music making. By incorporating free play and a game mode, we ensure that all a user can have a variety of experiences. 

This project utilizes an ESP32-WROVER as its primary core, with eight buttons and two analog joysticks. It has a single speaker outputting sound, all encased in a custom-designed 3D-printed case.
