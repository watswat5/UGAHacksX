Project Description:
This project aims to create an intuitive and interactive hand-held device that can be played as a musical instrument. By integrating sound synthesis and touch-sensitive controls, the device will allow users to create and manipulate musical synth sounds. Featuring scale selection, dynamic pitch modulation and differing synth settings, it offers a unique and engaging way to explore music making. By incorporating free play and a memory game mode, we ensure that users of all skill levels can have an enriching experience..

This project utilizes an ESP32-WROVER as its primary core, with eight buttons and two analog joysticks. It has a single speaker outputting sound, all encased in a custom-designed 3D-printed case.

The 3D models used can be found in the cad folder. Liberal hot glue was used to combine all parts together. The switch holes are sized to snap fit mechanical keyboard switches such as cherrymx.
